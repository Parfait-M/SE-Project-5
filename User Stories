User Stories:

User 1:
- As a user, I want to have some recurring reminder, as I am always late to class because I forget the time it starts

User 2:
- As a user, I want to have something hard to stop/snooze, as I always snooze or stop my alarms before going back to bed.

User 3:
- As a user, I want to be able to set my own songs to the alarms/reminders, as I love waking up to my own music, instead of
 generic android alarm sounds.

 User 4:
 - As a user, I want to be able to have different sounds to my reminders, as I tend to ignore sounds that I become familiar with.

Choosing user 4.
- Developing a system that creates alarms with different sounds was the most interesting. These sounds would feature somewhat irritating ones
in order to prevent the user from going back to bed etc.
